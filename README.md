## Overview
King County in Washington State is growing in population made up of millenials and generation Z who either grew up or migrated to the area and found life in the region. We, the Data Analysts at the Greek Honey real estate are woking on building a model that predicts house prices in King county with the goal to help folks from the demographic to find their dream house that fits their lifestyle and their pockets!
 
## Stakeholder  
  
## Business Problem
Every indiviual homeseeker desires features about their future home, but they do not always know how much it may cost them.  Using our multiple linear regression model we are able to predict housing prices in the King County region based off specific features.  This predictive model will be used when looking for houses to buy and sell.
  
## Data and Tools
To generate King County housing prices we used data from [King County Assessor Website](https://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/esales/Glossary.aspx?type=r) which provides ![column names and descriptions](./data/column_names.md) for King County data set in the years of 2014-2015.
