## Overview
King County in Washington State is growing in population made up of millenials and generation Z who either grew up or migrated to the area and found life in the region. We, the Data Analysts at the Greek Honey real estate are woking on building a model that predicts house prices in King county with the goal to help folks from the demographic to find their dream house that fits their lifestyle and their pockets!
 
## Stakeholder  
  
## Business Problem
Housing market in King County region, especially in the major cities such as Seattle, are becoming more and more financially inaccessible for many demographics. The demographic of interest for our real-estate is millenials who are building their career, family and trying to break into the housing market to have a stable housing for themselves. With our house price predicition model, we will help them to find the market value of their ideal house that are in proximity to city centers.
